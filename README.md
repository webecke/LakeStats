# PowellStats

A simple PWA to show current and historical conditions at Lake Powell in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah and Arizona.

## What
The goal is to make a simple webapp that:
- Simply displays the important info
  - Current lake elevation
  - Change over a week
  - Change since a year
  - Weather
  - Boat Ramp Availability
- Loads quickly (to work well at the Lake with slow connections)
- Looks nice
- Caches data for offline access

## Why
Other websites exist that display this information. However, currently they have frustrating user interfaces, cluttered data presentation, and load slowly. This project seeks to fix that.

Additionally, I just want to have a project to learn new technologies. This project will be the first time that I am using:
- Google Cloud Run
- Google Firebase
- GoLang
- React

## Deployment
This is not an open source project. I retain all possible rights to this code. However, for testing purposes or my own future documentation, here's info about how to deploy this: [deployment.md](deployment.md)
